\begin{document}
    \section{Db change}
        Did it first, got write denial, waited 
        
        did a second time 4.4 million rows, which crashed when we tried to transfer (too big) which made it even harder to transfer (SQL dump worked?!?!)

    \section{Password Hasher}
        Allowed old due to the setup
